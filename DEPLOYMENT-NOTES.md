# Deployment Notes - Successfully Tested Configuration

This document contains the exact configuration and steps that were successfully tested for deploying the ISAPI migration toolkit to Azure.

## Tested Configuration

**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Azure CLI Version:** 2.70.0  
**Deployment URL:** https://isapi-rapid-demo.azurewebsites.net  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Deployed and Validated

## Working Infrastructure Settings

### App Service Configuration
- **Tier:** Basic B1 (recommended minimum for ISAPI)
- **Platform:** Windows Server
- **Architecture:** 32-bit worker process (required for ISAPI compatibility)
- **Runtime:** .NET Framework 4.8 support
- **Region:** West US 2

### Key Bicep Template Fixes Applied
1. **Worker Process Architecture:** Added conditional logic for Free/Shared tier compatibility
2. **SKU Compatibility:** Basic B1 tier works well, Free tier has limitations
3. **ISAPI Extensions:** Properly configured for legacy application support

## Successful Deployment Commands

```powershell
# 1. Deploy infrastructure (from repository root)
az deployment group create `
  --resource-group "rg-isapi-rapid-demo" `
  --template-file "infrastructure/bicep/main.bicep" `
  --parameters "infrastructure/bicep/parameters.json" appName="isapi-rapid-demo"

# 2. Deploy application files
az webapp deploy --resource-group "rg-isapi-rapid-demo" --name "isapi-rapid-demo" --src-path "./deployment/default.htm" --type static --target-path "/default.htm"

# 3. Validate deployment
.\scripts\validate-deployment.ps1 -AppServiceUrl "https://isapi-rapid-demo.azurewebsites.net"
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ Basic connectivity: PASS
- ✅ SSL configuration: PASS  
- ✅ ISAPI filter readiness: PASS
- ✅ Uptime monitoring: 100% success rate
- ⚠️ Security headers: Partial (can be enhanced)

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Parameter Mismatch
**Issue:** Original guides referenced "environment" parameter not in Bicep template  
**Fix:** Removed environment parameter references from documentation

### 2. Tier Limitations
**Issue:** Standard tier quotas in some subscriptions  
**Fix:** Switched to Basic B1 tier which provides necessary features

### 3. Worker Process Architecture  
**Issue:** Free tier defaults to 64-bit, incompatible with some ISAPI filters  
**Fix:** Added conditional logic in Bicep template for architecture selection

### 4. Deployment Method
**Issue:** Zip deployment failed with generic error  
**Fix:** Used `az webapp deploy` with static type and target-path

## Database Dependencies Removal

All SQL Server and Azure SQL Database references have been completely removed from:
- Main documentation (README.md)
- All guide modules
- Architecture diagrams
- FAQ and checklists
- Bicep infrastructure templates
- Cost calculations

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Upload actual ISAPI Filter DLL** using deployment scripts
2. **Configure web.config** for specific ISAPI filter registration  
3. **Test custom endpoints** beyond the demo page
4. **Enable additional security headers** if required
5. **Set up monitoring alerts** in Application Insights

## Troubleshooting Notes

- Use `Basic B1` or higher for production ISAPI workloads
- Ensure 32-bit worker process is configured for legacy ISAPI filters
- Monitor Application Insights for performance and compatibility issues
- Use Kudu console for advanced debugging if needed
